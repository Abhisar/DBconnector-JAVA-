HELLO EVERYONE !!!!

This is a small project that would simplify the complexity of writing JDBC connection code.
This doc has been written with specific to Eclipse development environment

All you have to do is the following :

Step 1: First download the respective DataBase jars from vendor website.

Step 2: Right click on your project on eclipse.
        Then Properties ---> Java Build Path -->Libraries.
        In right side there would a option to include external jars.Just click it 
        and select the downloaded jars.

Step 3: Repeat step 2 again but this time include the jar i have provided i.e DBconnector.jar

Step 4: Copy the configurations.xml file from this folder to your project directory.

Step 5: Edit the config file according to your connection and this is it .
        By default I have given a sample connection credentials
        You are ready to go.

Step 6: To make establish a connection and make use of it you just have to type this much in your program.

      

        db_connector db = new db_connector();
        Connection x = db.getConn();
        

N.B : Please enter your db_driver propery in configuration.XML based on your database.
      A simple google search for class names for JDBC to connect to oracle or db2 or mysql or postgres will 
      do the trick .
